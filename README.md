**Contribution Streak Maintainer** is a tool, available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contribution-streak-maintainer), designed to be used inside a GitHub Actions workflow. This npm package is utilized within your workflow, automatically maintaining your GitHub contribution streak. The GitHub Actions workflow, configured through YAML files, generates and pushes commits to your repository, ensuring your activity stays active even on days when you're not able to make manual contributions.

3. Add the following workflow to your repository at `.github/workflows/contribution-streak-maintainer.yml`

```yaml

    # For more information on the cron scheduler,
    # see https://crontab.guru/ or https://crontab.cronhub.io/.

  - Example: `npx contribution-streak-maintainer my-username --email=my-primary-github-email@email.com --token=gph_nJkKQKJKFb7YxqkLtFf3wvXyU6X --condition=6`
- Verify changes in `AUTOMATED_CONTRIBUTIONS.md`.

## Configuration

| Param        | ENV alias             | Type   | Description                                                       | Default | Required |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `repository` | `DEVFUL_GITHUB_REPO`  | String | The owner and repository name. For example, `octocat/Hello-World` |         | Yes      |
| `email`      |                       | String | Primary email address associated with your GitHub account         |         | Yes      |
| `token`      | `DEVFUL_GITHUB_TOKEN` | String | Github Auth token                                                 |         | Yes      |
| `condition`  |                       | String | Condition for contribution to be made                             | 0       | No       |

By default, this action runs daily, checks if the user has made any contribution, and generates a random number of commits between 1-3. If the user sets the condition to, for example, 5, the action will only make commits if the user has made 0-5 commits that day.
